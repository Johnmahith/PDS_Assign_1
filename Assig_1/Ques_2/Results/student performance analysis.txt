- Among the five visualizations created, the Test Preparation Course Impact visualization provides the most straightforward analysis. This grouped bar chart directly compares the average scores in math, reading, and writing for students who completed a test preparation course against those who did not. It clearly illustrates the difference in performance across the three subjects based on whether or not a student engaged in test preparation. This visualization simplifies the understanding of the direct impact of test preparation courses on student performance, making it the easiest to interpret for assessing the value of these courses.
