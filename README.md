# Data Analysis Projects Repository

This repository hosts code and analysis for two projects: a frailty study in individuals and a student performance visualization study.

## Projects Overview

### Frailty Study Analysis (`pds_assign1_q1.ipynb`)
Analyzes physical weakness in individuals by performing a linear regression on grip strength and producing residual plots.

### Student Performance Visualization (`pds_assign1_q2.ipynb`)
Generates visualizations to explore student performance across various demographics and preparation levels.

## Structure and Usage

Each project consists of a script that processes data, performs analysis, and outputs results. Clone the repository, and run each script in a Python environment with the necessary packages installed.

### Data Preparation
Raw data is cleaned and processed for analysis. Cleaned data is saved to a CSV file.

### Data Analysis
Scripts perform statistical analysis or data visualization.

### Reporting
Results are plotted directly by the scripts or saved to text files for further interpretation.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed with `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`.
2. Place data files in the project directory.
3. Run `pds_assign1_q1.py` for frailty analysis or `pds_assign1_q2.py` for student performance visualization.

## Output

- Frailty Study: Regression output and residual plot.
- Student Performance: Five visualizations highlighting different aspects of performance data.
